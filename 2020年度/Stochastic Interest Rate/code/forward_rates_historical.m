% first forward rate in the family would expire in 1-year so only 1-year of data would be used. 
% This approach would seem to be preferable as forward rates in the LMM are characterized by

% Notes: 

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%
% Eurodollars are deposits denominated in US dollars at banks outside the United States, 
% and thus are not under the jurisdiction of the Federal Reserve. Consequently, such deposits 
% are subject to much less regulation than similar deposits within the United States, allowing 
% for higher margins.
%
% For more than 30 years, the London interbank market has been a major source of liquidity for 
% banks seeking to fund U.S. dollar-denominated loans. The market has worked efficiently to 
% enable banks in need of liquidity to obtain deposits of U.S. dollars, either on an 
% overnight basis or for fixed terms (typically, one, two, three or six months), from other 
% banks with excess liquidity.
%
% Those deposits are sometimes referred to as Eurodollar deposits; and the interest rate 
% on Eurodollar deposits is referred to as LIBOR or the LIBO Rate, standing for the London 
% interbank offered rate.1 The British Bankers Association (BBA) oversees the public 
% quotation of LIBOR by designating a panel of 16 U.S. and non-U.S. banks2 to furnish their 
% rates to Reuters, which publishes the average after eliminating the highest and lowest rates.
%
% For the data in H.15 data set: 
% Instrument: "Eurodollar deposits (London)"
% Maturity: "6-month"
% Frequency: "Business day"
% Description: "U.S. -- SHORT-TERM INTEREST RATES: DAILY 6-MONTH EURO-DOLLAR DEPOSIT RATE"
% Note: "Annualized using a 360-day year or bank interest."
% Note: "Bid rates for Eurodollar deposits collected around 9:30 a.m. Eastern time."
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%
% CME Eurodollar futures prices are determined by the markets forecast of 
% the 3-month USD LIBOR interest rate expected to prevail on the settlement date. 
% The settlement price of a contract is defined to be 100.00 minus the official 
% British Bankers Association fixing of 3-month LIBOR on the contract settlement date. 
% For example, if 3-month LIBOR sets at 5.00% on the contract settlement date, 
% the contract settles at a price of 95.00.
